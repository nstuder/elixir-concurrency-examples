# Simple Parallel Merge Sort

Ths Example uses Tasks to implement a parallel Version of Merge Sort

At First a List of Random Numbers is generated. Then the List is sorted with the sequential Algorithm and with the parallel Algorithm using Tasks. The Execution Time of both is printed on the Console.

### compile 

```bash
mix compile
iex -S mix
```

### run
```elixir
Sort.main()
```
